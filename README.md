## When is Base64 Conversion Useful?
Base64 encoding is often used in scenarios where binary data needs to be safely transferred or stored as text. Here are some common use cases:

- **Data Transmission**: Encode binary data (e.g., images, files) for safe transmission over text-based protocols such as email or JSON APIs.
- **Web Development**: Embed images or other binary content directly into HTML or CSS as data URIs.
- **Data Storage**: Store binary data in text-based databases or configuration files.
- **Authentication**: Encode credentials for basic authentication in HTTP headers.

> **Note**: Base64 is not encryption. It ensures data integrity when transferring binary information over systems that might alter raw binary data.
